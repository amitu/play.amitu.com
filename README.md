Purpose: This can be used to forward requests to play.golang.org from
Javascript. It adds appropriate CORS headers for cross site usage.

play.golang guys have given me permission to use this only for represent. So it
should only be used by a represent generated slide.

Demo: [play.amitu.com](http://play.amitu.com).

PS: play.golang guys let you use
[this service](http://blog.golang.org/playground) if you want to use this for
any other purpose you can, all they ask you is that you
[contact them first](mailto:golang-dev@googlegroups.com), use a unique user
agent in your requests (so we can identify you), and that your service is of
benefit to the Go community. Be cool.
